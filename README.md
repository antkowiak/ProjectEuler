# ProjectEuler
My solutions to the Project Euler problem set

These are the solutions I came up with on my own, without looking at any solution set.
I did my best to optimize the results, the best I can. Obviously, there are some
very advanced topics in mathematics that can be used for greater optimizations.
However, this is a representation of my best effort without looking at any outside sources.
